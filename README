Disasters and catastrophes wreak havoc on people, communities, and entire cultures around the world every year. 
They are expected to increase in frequency in the future, which is alarming. Natural disasters like tornadoes, 
hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, mudslides, or droughts can happen, or they can be created by people 
(e.g., mass shootings, chemical spills, or terrorist attacks). The behavioral health of individuals and communities
depends on their ability to prevent disasters and traumatic events, to respond to them, and to recover from them. 

People may react in a variety of ways when faced with a disaster, many of which are normal reactions to difficult 
circumstances. After a calamity, most people demonstrate resilience. Resilience is the capacity to overcome obstacles
and persevere under difficult circumstances. Fortunately, resilience in catastrophe recovery is commonplace rather 
than exceptional, and people frequently show this ability. supportive tools.

Specifically about floods.

Many people around the world live in zones that are more prone to floodings than others, we have taken the challenge 
to help all those people around the world that in case of emergency they may need to communicate, 
and we are aiming to create a system based on a network mounted in drones, to help people connect to send messages through 
that network in order to let people contact emergency services an to let them know where they are and what they need.

It's a very interesting and important challenge to achieve.
